## Reporting a Vulnerability

<!-- Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc. -->

To report a security vulnerability you should create a [security GitHub issue](https://github.com/DillonB07/GitStats/issues/new/choose). Once reviewed, I will inform all users of a security vulnerability and how to avoid it.

### What informaton should I include in my issue?

Make sure you say explicitly what the vulnerability is, how you can avoid it(if you know how) and a solution(if you know how).

***All security issues will be high priority.***
